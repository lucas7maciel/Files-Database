# Files-Database
This script allows the user to manipulate and store simple data using textfiles.

With this code you can:
Create files
Print out
Add new lines
Alter
Delete

The file 'fileList.txt' will always be printed above the options, so that the user has knowledge of his data and can manipulate it in the way he prefers.
